# Molecular and spatial characterization of adipocyte heterogeneity in functional and cardiometabolic health

### ABSTRACT
Adipose tissue is central to systemic energy balance and metabolic health, yet the cellular complexity of human abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ASAT) remains incompletely defined. Here, we integrate single-nucleus RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, secretome proteomics, ex vivo fatty acid uptake, in vitro adipogenesis, and cell-type deconvolution across deeply phenotyped human cohorts. We identify two transcriptionally and functionally distinct adipocyte subtypes defined by GABRE expression. The high-GABRE subtype, AdipoHG, displays enriched lipid metabolic programs, greater insulin-stimulated fatty acid uptake ex vivo, and spatial localization near endothelial—but not macrophage—niches. Higher AdipoHG abundance is associated with reduced ectopic fat, improved lipid profiles, insulin sensitivity, and physical performance. AdipoHG-derived secreted factors were linked to favorable skeletal muscle energetics and function. Adipocyte heterogeneity was observed in SVF-derived cultures, and iPSC-derived adipocytes confirmed GABRE as a marker of mature, metabolically healthy adipocytes. These findings position adipocyte specialization as a key determinant of ASAT function and systemic health. <img width="468" height="236" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae3f5469-56aa-49a8-854b-05507e80b92d" />
